/* audio.hpp:
 *
 * This file contains the necessary definitions for playing audio using our Arduino setup. It has been designed to
 * operate as a driven device needing to be driven at a set rate such that it can play a sound. This rate is the sample
 * rate of the audio it is playing.  Typically this rate should be 2x more that the highest frequency component of the
 * sound being played.
 *
 * Since the Arduino is a 5V digital device, the audio played will be a square wave. This wave is then threshold and
 * played on the speaker. Better audio could be achieved with analog circuits, however; that is outside the scope of the
 * lesson.
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * ```
 * ArduinoSound& sound = ...// Fill in reference with non-abstract subtype
 * sound.init(6, 8000);     // Output to pin 6, at a frequency of 8KHz
 * ...
 * // Every 100Hz
 * sound.play();
 * sound.prep_sample(); // Sets the next sample to play
 * ```
